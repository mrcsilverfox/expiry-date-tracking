A Very Good Project created by Very Good CLI.

## Getting Started üöÄ

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*App works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:app/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```

## Docs
The app folder contains only the bloc and view (the presentation layer).
The core functionality are defined and implemented inside the packages folder. 

Others funcionalities use the clean architecture structure. (data, domain, presentation). 

### Core
#### Package open_food_facts_api
We use the open food facts api to fetch the scanned product. We use the barcode to fetch the product. In the future we will can use own APIs, so is important to organize the code. 

The package `open_food_facts_api` contains the client. It allows to fetch a product from the barcode. It return an open food facts product object. 

#### Package open_food_facts_api_repository
The package `open_food_facts_api_repository` contains our Product model. This allows us to not be coupled with the open api product implementation. The repo use the open food facts client to fetch the product and returns our product model. The model contains name, brand name and images.

#### Package products_api
The package `products_api` contains our data source. It is charge of manipulating the products entity. It defines simple CRUD operations, the domain product entity and the data product model. It will be used by the `products_repository`. 

The only one implementation of products_api is `memory_products_api`. It stores products in memory. When the app is restarted, all products will be removed.

Next implementations are: `sql_products_api` and `remote_products_api`. The first allows the user to store prodcuts in a local db. The letter stores the products in the cloud. 

#### Package products_repository
The package `products_repository` uses the `products_api` to retrive products, to add, edit and modify user's products. 
In this case the repository is not an interface, but it is a concrete class.
